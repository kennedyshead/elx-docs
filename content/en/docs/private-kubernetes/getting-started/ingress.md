In this example we will expose a simple web service using Let's Encrypt staging certificates. We will do the following:

* Create a *namespace* called `my-web-service`
* Create an *Issuer* that configures *cert manager* for our namespace
* Create a *deployment* that runs multiple pods
* Create a *service* selecting pods from the above deployment
* Create an *ingress* that uses the *nginx ingress controller* and *cert manager*

In our examples, all references the domain name `example.tld` needs to be changed to your own DNS record, which you point to the IP addresses given by us. We will use the *HTTP-01* challenge which means you need to do this before anything else.

> These examples are only to show how you get started with *Nginx Ingress Controller*, *Cert Manager* to get *Let's Encrypt* working.

## Create and apply manifests

After you saved each manifest, you should run `kubectl create -f <manifest>.yaml`.

Paste this yaml into `namespace-my-web-service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: my-web-service
```

Now let's configure an *Issuer* that works inside this namespace. An *issuer* in cert manager helps sending a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to an ACME server, in our example the ACME is Let's Encrypt boulder server. On its own, this does nothing. It acts on annotations `certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod` which we will see in the *ingress* manifest.

With modified email address, save this into `issuer-my-web-service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: letsencrypt-prod
  namespace: my-web-service
spec:
  acme:
    # Let's Encrypt ACME server for production certificates
    server: https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory
    # This email address will get notifications if failure to renew certificates happens
    email: valid-email@example.tld
    privateKeySecretRef:
      name: letsencrypt-prod
    http01: {}
```

Our deployment manifest. It runs a simple serve_hostname container just presenting the hostname. Save this to `deployment-my-web-service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-web-service
  name: my-web-service
  namespace: my-web-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-web-service
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-web-service
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1001
        fsGroup: 1001
      containers:
      - image: k8s.gcr.io/serve_hostname
        name: servehostname
        ports:
        - containerPort: 9376
```

Our service, matching all pods from our deployment. Save this to `service-my-web-service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  labels:
    app: my-web-service
  name: my-web-service
  namespace: my-web-service
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 9376
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 9376
  selector:
    app: my-web-service
  type: ClusterIP
```

And last but not least our *ingress*. Save this to `ingress-my-web-service.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-web-service-ingress
  namespace: my-web-service
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/tls-acme: "true"
    certmanager.k8s.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - example.tld
    secretName: example-tld
  rules:
  - host: example.tld
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: my-web-service
          servicePort: 9376
```

## Final words

End result should be a web service printing out current pods hostname with SSL enabled and the certificate issued by Let's Encrypt:
